# sixpack

Library for compression and decompression using the Sixpack algorithm originally written by Philip G. Gage.

I created this library, because I was in the process of reverse engineering a file format compressed using Sixpack. However, I barely found enough information describing the algorithm, which is why I took some time to create this library.

## Installation

TBD
